# Tably

Python script for converting .csv data to LaTeX tables.


# Features

* easy to use - just provide a .csv file
* optionally escapes commonly used special LaTeX characters, such as `$`, `&`, `%`, etc.
* user-defined separators - comma, tab, semicolon, etc.
* units for each column can be specified
* possible to define table caption and label
* columns' alignments can be customized
* can be used on multiple .csv files at the same time
* table can be added to the existing .tex file
* can generate only the fragment inside a tabular environment for inserting into another tex file
* when working with multiple .csv files, can optionally save each table in a different file


# Requirements

Python 3.4+

It uses `booktabs` package for creating the tables (nicer looking tables than the default `tabular`), which is included in TeXLive distribution and should be automatically installed in MiKTeX distribution.


# Installation

For a test run all you need to do is download the file [`tably.py`](tably.py) and put it in the directory where you would like to use it and run it by typing:
```bash
$ python tably.py filename.csv [arguments]
```

If you wish to use it repeatedly, a good idea would be to make it executable and add it to your $PATH, which simplifies usage and makes it possible to use it in any directory:
```bash
$ tably filename.csv [arguments]
```


# Usage

See the folder [examples](examples/) for the input files used in the following examples.

The most basic example:
```bash
$ tably examples/example1.csv
```

outputs to console:
```tex
% \usepackage{booktabs} % move this to preamble and uncomment

\begin{table}[htb]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{@{}cccc@{}}
        \toprule
        Name & Qty & Price per kg & Price \\
        \midrule
        Apples & 10.2 & 5 & 51.0 \\
        Bananas & 7.3 & 11 & 80.3 \\
        Cherries & 5.7 & 30 & 171.0 \\
        Dates & 3.5 & 90 & 315.0 \\
        Eggs & 6.4 & 2 & 12.8 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
```
which is ready to be copied to your existing LaTeX document.


If you want the output to be appended to your existing .tex file, use the option `-o filename.tex`.  
If you want to create a new file, you probably want to include a preamble too (so the new .tex document is ready to be build as .pdf), which can be done by passing the `-p` option (along with specifying outfile as above).

All options can be seen by using `-h` or `--help`:
```bash
$ tably -h
```

```
usage: tably [-h] [-a ALIGN] [-c CAPTION] [-i] [-k SKIP] [-l LABEL] [-n]
             [-o OUTFILE] [-oo [SEPARATE_OUTFILES [SEPARATE_OUTFILES ...]]]
             [-p] [-s SEP] [-u UNITS [UNITS ...]] [-e] [-f] [-ff] [-r]
             files [files ...]

Creates LaTeX tables from .csv files

positional arguments:
  files                 .csv file(s) containing the data you want to export.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a ALIGN, --align ALIGN
                        Alignment for the columns of the table. Use `l`, `c`,
                        and `r` for left, center and right. Either one
                        character for all columns, or one character per
                        column. Default: c
  -c CAPTION, --caption CAPTION
                        Caption of the table. Default: None
  -i, --no-indent       Pass this if you do not want to indent LaTeX source
                        code with 4 spaces per float. No difference in the
                        final result (pdf). Default: False
  -k SKIP, --skip SKIP  Number of rows in .csv to skip. Default: 0
  -l LABEL, --label LABEL
                        Label of the table, for referencing it. Default: None
  -n, --no-header       By default, the first row of .csv is used as a table
                        header. Pass this option if there is no header.
                        Default: False
  -o OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE
                        Choose an output file to save the results. The results
                        are appended to the file (added after the last line).
                        Default: None, prints to console.
  -oo [SEPARATE_OUTFILES [SEPARATE_OUTFILES ...]], --separate-outfiles [SEPARATE_OUTFILES [SEPARATE_OUTFILES ...]]
                        When multiple .csv files need to be processed, pass a
                        list of filenames after -oo at the end of the command
                        to save each individual table to one of the files
                        based on order. If no filenames are passed after -oo,
                        filenames of .csv files will be used.
  -p, --preamble        If selected, makes a whole .tex document (including
                        the preamble) ready to be built as .pdf. Useful when
                        trying to make a quick report. Default: False
  -s SEP, --sep SEP     Choose a separator between columns. If a file is tab-
                        separated, pass `t` or `tab`. If a file is semicolon-
                        separated, pass `s`, `semi` or `\;`.Default: `,`
                        (comma-separated)
  -u UNITS [UNITS ...], --units UNITS [UNITS ...]
                        Provide units for each column. If column has no unit,
                        denote it by passing either `-`, `/` or `0`. If `--no-
                        header` is used, this argument is ignored.
  -e, --no-escape       If selected, do not escape special LaTeX characters
  -f, --fragment        If selected, only output content inside tabular
                        environment (no preamble, table environment, etc.)
  -ff, --fragment-skip-header
                        Equivalent to passing -k 1 -n -f (suppress header when
                        they are on the first row of .csv and pass -f)
  -r, --replace         If selected and -o is passed, overwrite any existing
                        output file
```

More complex examples:

```bash
$ tably examples/example1.csv -o examples/table1.tex -p -a lrcr -u / kg $ $ -l tab:ex1 -c "Prices of breakfasts"
```

Saves the output (`-o`) to [examples/table1.tex](examples/table1.tex) file, containing a preamble (`-p`), alignment of the columns (`-a`) in the table is left-right-center-right (`lrcr`), units (`-u`) for each column are provided (`/` represents no unit, same as `0` and `-`), table label (`-l`) is `tab:ex1` and the caption (`-c`) is `Prices of breakfasts`.
The final result is at [examples/table1.pdf](examples/table1.pdf).

---

```bash
$ tably examples/example2.csv -o examples/table2.tex -p -a r -n -k 3
```

Here the alignment for a whole table is right (`-a r`), there is no header (`-n`) and we skip first three rows of .csv file (`-k 3`).
The final result is at [examples/table2.pdf](examples/table2.pdf).

---

```bash
$ tably examples/example3.csv -ef -ro examples/table3.tex
```

When .csv files contain special LaTeX characters
that are supposed to be reserved in the output,
the --no-escape (-e) option suppresses the default escaping.
To include the output in a tex file that already contains
a tabular environment by calling \input{table3.tex},
only the fragment (-f) inside the environment is generated.
If the output file already exists,
it will be replaced by the output (-r).

---

```bash
$ tably examples/*.csv -oo 1.tex 2.tex 3.tex -p
```

Output for each table is saved into a different file
with the --separate-outfiles (-oo) option and an optional list of output file names specified.
Alternatively, an output directory can be passed after -oo.
If no file name comes after -oo,
the same file names for the .csv files will be used
(replacing .csv extension with .tex, or appending .tex if no .csv extension is included in the filename).


# FAQ

> There are online tools which can do the same stuff. Why would I use `tably`?

Imagine yourself being stranded on a desert island with you laptop, but without internet, and you need to convert all those .csv's to .pdf before you can be rescued...

> Can I pass multiple .csv files all at once?

You can, and this is best used if the data in all those .csv files is similar - same number of columns, same data types (so you can use the same alignment for all tables), etc. Like multiple outputs of a same software/machine/procedure.

If your .csv files are different, it might be easier to call `tably` multiple times, one .csv file per call.

> I found a bug and/or have feature request, how can I contact you?

Please use this project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/narimiran/tably/issues).
If you found a bug, please be as detailed as possible to make it easier for me to be able to reproduce it and fix it.
